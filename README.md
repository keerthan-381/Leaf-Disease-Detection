Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a fundamental machine learning model that, in the case of linear data, produces the most optimal 
Hyperplane and, in the case of non-linear data, uses the concept of Kernels.

K–Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
This supervised learning model divides the data into classes so that when a new data point enters the model, it first 
sees its K-nearest neighbours, then the neighbour with the highest frequency among those neighbours, and the data 
point is aligned with the class. This step is repeated for all data points that have been properly categorized and entered 
the model.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
It is a subdomain of Deep Learning algorithms in which these algorithms, when implemented in a real-time 
environment, view the world through the eyes of humans and work in a manner like humans, and these algorithms are 
trained in all the possible ways humans can think about a given scenario in each situation.
•Input Layer: The input layer consists of images provided as input to the model; in this layer, image data is saved 
in pixels and stored in nodes, and every operation in CNN occurs in nodes.
•Hidden Layer: This layer's hidden layer handles with computations such as data processing, feature extraction, 
and data transformation. The more hidden levels in the CNN design, the more complex the architecture becomes.
The data processing in the hidden layer allows the model to learn features and perform quickly with real-time data, 
making it more equivalent to the CNN models currently in use. The CNN's activation functions determine whether a 
neuron should be activated based on the node's value.
•Output Layer: The output layer is a fully linked layer where the hidden layer's outputs are flattened and taken as 
an input. This layer accepts input and turns it into the desired classes.
